# front_end_creative


All credit should go to the creator of the following: 
https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative

I am using this for educational purposes. 

Put gitpod.io/# in front of the url. 
Then go to the left hand side and click extension and is the 5th icon down. 
Search Live Preview and install it. 

Then go back to index.html. 
Then click the farthest left icon on the top right with the eye glass. 
Then you should be able to see the preview of the creative theme that this person has created. 
(Again, this was NOT me!!)
